1. Blazor Server

Program.cs		-> .Run() : it is a infinity while loop, checking if a HttpRequest has aquare
				-> first thing that is from Main is Startup.cs

StartUp.cs		-> ctor: Startup (IConfiguration congiguration)
						-> configuration: appsettings.json, ...
						-> in blazor WASM there is no appsetting.json but we can add one
						-> this method is called by the Runtime
						-> use this method to add services to the container

				-> ConfigureServices
					-> where you set classes for dependency injection
					
				-> Configure
					-> specifies the middleware pipeline for a request
					-> middleware : from when a request comes in and a response goes out				
						

-- ConfigureServices.cs --

->AddHubOptions: set options on the SignalR Hub so you can send larger message between Server and UI
services.AddServerSideBlazor().AddHubOptions(
		options => {options.MaximumReceiveMessageSize = 50000; });

-- Configure.cs --

if (env.IsDevelopment())				// if the enviroment is Development
{
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();	// Index.razor, _Host.cshtml
}
else{
	app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");	// use this page
	app.UseHsts();
}

app.UseHttpsRedirection();	-> redirect http calls to https calls;

app.UseStaticFiles();		-> for using css, html, img, files

app.UseRouting();			-> routing is responsible for matching incomming HTTP requests and 
							   dispatching those requests to the app's executable endpoints(ex: page)

app.UseEndpoints			-> the most typical configuration is to route all requests to a Razor page, 
								which acts as the host for the server-side part of the Blazor Server app
							-> the route specified in the host file is a called a fallback route because 
							    it operates with a low priority in route matching
							-> the fallback route is considered when the other routes don't match
							-> this allows the app to use others controllers and pages without interfering 
							    with the Blazor Server app


-- App.razor --

-> root component of the app that sets up client-side routing using the Route component

MainPage: _Host.cshtml

-- MainLayout --

@inherits LayoutComponentBase : this is a must have 

-> we don't need to have MainLayout.razor but we need to inherit from LayoutComponentBase 
if we make our own razor page

@Body: encompasses everything that you page dispays
<NavLink> : combines a link with buttons, icons, 
			matching to routes so you can also utilize authentication or authorization



2. Blazor WebAssembly
	
-> in a WASM app there is no difference between a Scoped and a Singleton Service in terms of his lifetime
   there is only one client: the browser user	

MainPage : wwwroot -> index.html

-> the <link> in the index.html are there to support the main layout, but we can remove them 
-> <base> element must be in the page

<link href="css/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="css/app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="06_ProjectOverview_BlazorWebAssembly.Client.styles.css" rel="stylesheet" />


-- WheatherForecast.cs --
-> the client uses a HTTP client to call an API controller to get this weather forecast

-- index.html --

<script src="_framework/blazor.webassembly.js"></script>

-> the JS that need to load to support blazer
-> it's a shim that download the .net runtime(which is a CLR - command line runtime) in base class libraries, 
the app , all the dependencies, all of the dll's, all the assemblies
-> initializes the runtime to run the app
