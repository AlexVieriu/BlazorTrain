There are 2 types of blazor components:
-> simple component 
-> page component   (has at the top :  @page "/home" )

How blazor page components are created():

-> show hidden files
obj-> debug-> bet5.0 -> RazorDeclaration -> Pages -> Counter.razor.g.cs

-> a blazor page component is actualy a public partial class:

[Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RouteAttribute("/counter")]
public partial class Counter : Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.ComponentBase
{
    protected override void BuildRenderTree(Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Rendering.RenderTreeBuilder __builder)
    {
    }
       
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}

-> we use Reflection to make the routing work

-- App.razor --

<Router AppAssembly="@typeof(Program).Assembly" >
-> the router need to know what Assembly is looking at
-> then he find all of the classes that have that route attribute, then he build a table in memory
-> and apply a filter, for this page this are all the routes(a page can have multiple routes)

<Found Context="routeData">
-> if we found the page, route, component with the filter we put on the above then 

<RouteView RouteData="@routeData" DefaultLayout="@typeof(MainLayout)" />
-> show it with <RouteView>
