What is WASM?
-> not a language
-> not a compiler
-> virtual machine
-> target for compilers, just like OS
-> it proved a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near native speed 

Security:
-> code running in wasm can't interact with the web directly
-> wasm need to cal js which then makes the web api call
-> wasm call JS


Compiling to WASM
-> EMSCRIPTEN for C/C++
-> great toturial

Performance:
-> general : WASM faster than JS
